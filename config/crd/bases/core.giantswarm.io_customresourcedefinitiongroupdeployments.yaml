                          instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in
                          some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster
                          DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may also
                          be an IP address. \n Please note that using `localhost`

                          care to run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver

                          must begin with \"https://\". \n A path is optional, and
                          if present may be any string permissible in a URL. You may
                          use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook,
                          for example, a cluster identifier. \n Attempting to use
                          a user or basic auth e.g. \"user:password@\" is not allowed.
