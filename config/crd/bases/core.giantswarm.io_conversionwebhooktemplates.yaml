                      Service must be specified. \n The `host` should not refer to
                      a service running in the cluster; use the Service field instead.
                      The host might be resolved via external DNS in some apiservers
                      (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that
                      would be a layering violation). `host` may also be an IP address.
                      \n Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host`
                      is risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all
                      hosts which run an apiserver which might need to make calls
                      to this webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable,
                      i.e., not easy to turn up in a new cluster. \n The scheme must
                      be \"https\"; the URL must begin with \"https://\". \n A path
                      is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                      a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                      webhook, for example, a cluster identifier. \n Attempting to
                      use a user or basic auth e.g. \"user:password@\" is not allowed.
                      Fragments (\"#...\") and query parameters (\"?...\") are not
                      allowed, either."
